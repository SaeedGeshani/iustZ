# IUSTZ-RankingCore-
Hi there!
You are about to experience a horrifying apocalypse in which you serve as your world's savior.
IUSTZ is basically a text-based RPG and the instructions are as follows:
1.As the game starts, you are provided with two options : 1.to create a new warrior of your own / 2.to pick one of the existing characters in the save file. If you choose option 1, you'll be asked to set a name and a gender for your custom warrior. But in case of option 2, you should type in the name of the character on the list which you'd like to pick.
2.Afterwards, you set a difficulty before getting started.
